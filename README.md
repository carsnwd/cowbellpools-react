# Cowbell Pools
Source code for the Cowbell Pools site. Purpose is to host a simple website for running football pools.
-I want to be able to create a league/group and invite other people.
-I want people to login and be able to add their picks, and use those picks to join a league/group to compete with others.
-I want the league to be able to give standings for each week in a group.

Code split into client and server, client will hold the React app and server will hold the Firebase cloud functions using Express or Hapi.
